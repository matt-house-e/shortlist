# Shortlist

Welcome to **Shortlist** — your AI-powered product research assistant.

Tell me what you want to buy, and I'll build a curated comparison table through conversation. No more jumping between review sites, forums, and retailer pages.



## What You Can Do

| Capability | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| 🔍 **Research Products** | Find products across any category based on your requirements |
| 📊 **Compare Options** | Get a side-by-side comparison table with specs that matter to you |
| 💡 **Get Recommendations** | See top picks with trade-offs explained |
| 🔄 **Refine Results** | Adjust criteria, add comparison fields, or find more options |
| 📥 **Export Data** | Download the full comparison as CSV |

**Three ways to start:**

**🛒 Product** — "I need a kettle under £50" / "Looking for a gaming laptop"
**📋 Requirements** — "Electric car, £30-40k, 200+ mile range"
**❓ Open-ended** — "What should I look for in a mechanical keyboard?"



## How It Works

```
You describe what you want
        ↓
I ask a few quick questions
        ↓
I search and build a comparison table
        ↓
You review, refine, decide
```

The system finds 20-30 products, enriches them with real specs from official sources, and presents your top options with trade-off analysis.



## Tips for Great Results

The more context you give, the better your shortlist.

✓ **State your budget** — even a rough range helps narrow the search
✓ **Mention must-haves** — "needs USB-C" or "must have variable temperature"
✓ **Share priorities** — "build quality over features" or "value for money"
✓ **Note constraints** — "no plastic" or "not from X brand"
✓ **Add context** — "for home office" or "upgrading from a 5-year-old model"
✓ **Refine as you go** — "add battery life to the comparison" or "find 10 more like these"



## Current Limitations

| What | Status |
|:-----|:-------|
| **Memory** | No history between sessions — each chat starts fresh |
| **Scope** | Product research only — no checkout or price tracking |
| **Data** | Specs from official sources — may not include every retailer's price |
| **Session** | One product search per conversation — start fresh for different products |



## Example Conversations

**Quick search:**
> "Electric kettle, under £50, variable temperature, stainless steel"

**Guided discovery:**
> "I need a new TV for gaming but I'm not sure what specs matter"

**Specific requirements:**
> "Looking for a second hand BMW 3 Series, 2018-2022, under £25k, diesel, manual"

**Refinement:**
> "These are good, but add fuel economy to the comparison"
> "Find me 5 more like the Fellow but cheaper"
